Introduction:
The wine storage database management system (WSDBMS) has been designed to store details about manufacturing, storing and selling wines to the customers. Customers can place their order for immediate delivery or buy wines from our Wine-Mart, we can provide the wines from our Inventory. Wine-mart are supplied with the wines made in our own vineyards. Collecting all the disparate information and compiling it into one easily accessible database is the goal of our wine storage DBMS. The design of this database is based on information that needs to be collected or has been collected in the past. The driving philosophy behind the database design was to have an efficient, normalized database that would be easy to maintain and expand and allow for easy data entry and access.
 
With this database design, we want to make it easier for the organization to maintain data about all their customers and orders. It also allows us to keep a close track of every step of the delivery process as well. Details about the wine mart and the vineyard which is supplying the processed wine are also being maintained to make sure that the organization can always maintain the right stock level to provide a hassle-free experience to their customers. There are employees who work at the Vineyards or Wine-mart and the details about supply and suppliers of the raw materials that are used, are also tracked in our database.
